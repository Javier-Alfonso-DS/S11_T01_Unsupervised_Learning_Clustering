S11.T01.-Unsupervised Learning Clustering

Description
We are going to practice and become familiar with clustering algorithms.

Level 1

- Exercise 1
Cluster the different flights using the K-means algorithm.

Level 2

- Exercise 2
Group the different flights using the hierarchical clustering algorithm.

Level 3

- Exercise 3
Calculate the performance of clustering using a parameter such as silhouette.
